# EmployeesPresenceInsightDashboard
In this project I have taken the data of an organisation for a quarter(April-May-June) which has  all the information on all the employees working preferences like work from home , work from office how many leaves they are taking etc.This data is stored in the excel file named Attendance Sheet 2022-2023_Masked.xlsx.
From this data I have created a POWER BI dashboard to understand trends in data.For example - Around 12% of employees like to work fom home on Friday.It captures some of the similar trends.
The graphics and data are stored in EmployeePresenceInsightsDashboard.pbix file and also stored in pdf format(EmployeePresenceInsightsDashboard.pdf).
